# Helium budget proposal

A Budget Proposal system for Helium Payments with the Masternode functions that make sense.

## How to run

1. Clone both the back and frontend.
1. Install dashd and dash-cli to your (linux) system.
1. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and change contents (in root directories).
1. Run `dashd` and start the back and frontend with `npm run dev` separately.

## Development stages

A stage is basically a bunch of features. Starting with the most critical and moving down to nice to have stuff. The front-end will be developed at the same time as backend, but no extra prettyness will be added until main features are implemented (unless we find a front-end dev). The website ideally will be public throughout all of the developemnt.

# Questions still unanswered

- Offer pre-proposals on-site? Dash has their forum for it.
- Solution for hundreds of proposals? Dash doesn't want to lower their entry fee.
- Markdown vs. WYSIWYG?
- Is providing the email a privacy concern?
- How to have proposal owner accountable after budget allocated?
